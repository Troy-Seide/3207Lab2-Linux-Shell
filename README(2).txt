README
Description: The Linux Shell is a program that functions as an intermediary between the user and the computer. You as the user are able to express commands which enable you to do things such as move through paths and access files of your choice along with many other perks as well. Simultaneously, the computer interprets these commands and does underlying work that is hidden to the user. Thus, resulting in the execution of the instructions presented.

Argument List Processing:
- These will be the commands where you as the user are able to enter in the shell to access or complete whatever task is at hand.
cd - change directory
clr - clear the screen
dir - print contents of directory
environ - list the environment variables
echo - print the user’s input
help - display the user manual
pause - pause the shell until the user presses enter
quit - exit the program

Navigation | I/O:
- Redirection commands help you as the user navigate and control where things may need to go such as input to a text file as well as direct the workflow for what you are trying to achieve. Another thing is that with the use of redirection commands they help you as the user separate jobs that you want to run in the background from jobs you want to run in the foreground. Hence, allowing you to run simple programs concurrently.  
> -  output redirection command
< - input redirection command
>> - append output to file
| - Pipe command where the output becomes the input for a different command
/- represents root directory
& - moves a command to the background of the shell
&& - Executes second command if the first command is successful
